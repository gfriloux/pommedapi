  <h1 class="page-heading">Pommedapi</h1>
    Pommedapi is project that aims at generating reports from web queries.<br />
    Given a set of test queries, it will help yourself to detect defects
    in your web API.<br />
    Regression tests can also be done through Pommedapi.<br /><br />
    You can access source code <a href="https://github.com/gfriloux/botman">here</a>.
    <br /><br />


  <h2>Seeing example output</h2>
    You can watch the result generated by the test files from our
    <a href="https://github.com/gfriloux/pommedapi/tree/master/examples/foaas.com" target=_blank>foaas.com test files</a>
    by going  <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/examples/foaas.com">here</a>.
    <br /><br />

  <h2>Create your own tests</h3>
    First, you need to create a main directory to handle your tests :
    <pre><code class="bash">$ mkdir mysite.tld
$ cd mysite.tld</code></pre>

    <h3>Create main configuration file</h3>
      pommdapi needs a general <b>pommedapi.conf</b> file with host and port to
      use for web queries.<br />
      Example file to query foaas.com :
      <pre><code class="json">{
   "host" : "www.foaas.com",
   "port" : 80
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Create your first test</h3>
      Each test have to be inside its own directory.<br />
      Tests are sorted by alphabetical order, so prefixing their name
      with a number is a good practice to order them.<br />

      <pre><code class="bash">$ mkdir 001_uri_anyway
$ cd 001_uri_anyway</code></pre>

      You need to create a <b>query.json</b> file that will look like this :
      <pre><code class="json">{
   "uri" : "/anyway/company/author",
   "description" : "Check foaas's /anyway.",
   "headers" : [
      {
         "name"  : "Accept",
         "value" : "application/json"
      }
   ],
   "timeout" : 10,
   "expect" : {
      "time" : 1000,
      "http_code" : 200
   }
}</code></pre>
  <table class="table table-striped table-hover ">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>object</th>
        <th>description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>.uri</td>
        <td>This string contains the URI to query</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.description</td>
        <td>Description for you to quickly understand what this test is about.<br />
            It will be added on the HTML report generated by Pommedapi.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.headers[]</td>
        <td>Allows to specify additionnal headers for the query.<br />
            You might need to set headers for doing various things, such as
            authentication.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.timeout</td>
        <td>Max waiting time for server to give an answer.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.expect.time</td>
        <td>Maximum response time before raising a warning</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.expect.http_code</td>
        <td>Expected returned http code for the query</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <br /><br />
    <h3>Create a POST query</h3>
      By creating a <b>data</b> file, your query will automatically become
      a POST query, sending whats inside your <b>data</b> file.
    <br /><br />

    <h3>Validate returned data</h3>
      Create a file named <b>validate</b> inside the test directory, and
      it will be automatically executed, receiving returned data as
      argument.<br />
      See the <b>examples/</b> directory from pommedapi's source code
      for examples of json validation through a shell script (uses
      the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" target=_blank>jq</a>
      command)
